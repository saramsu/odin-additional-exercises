    <h1>CSS - Method 1: External </h1>
<p>"Internal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <style> tags, which are then placed inside of the opening and closing <head> tags of your HTML file. Since the styles are being placed directly inside of the <head> tags, we no longer need a <link> element that the external method requires."</p>

<div>
        
    You can use CSS to style the disclosure widget, and you can programmatically open and close the widget by setting/removing its open attribute. Unfortunately, at this time there's no built-in way to animate the transition between open and closed.
